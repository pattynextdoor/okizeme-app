# NetherRealm Studios shuts down all support for Mortal Kombat 11!

It is unfortunately the end of the current era of Mortal Kombat. NetherRealm studios has posted via Twitter page @MortalKombat that it will be ceasing all support for Mortal Kombat 11, and the current version of the game will remain as the final version of the game. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NetherRealm is now focusing on its next project and after more than two years of supporting Mortal Kombat 11, DLC for the game, including characters, has come to an end.</p>&mdash; Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate (@MortalKombat) <a href="https://twitter.com/MortalKombat/status/1411006897868578821?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## What does this mean for the players and fans?

As fantastic as *Mortal Kombat 11* was for everyone, this is actually great news for the player base. **Mortal Kombat's timeline for creating new games has always been about two-year increments.** *Mortal Kombat 11*, first released in March 2019, has been a pivotal installment to one of gaming's oldest and most famous fighting game franchise. MK11 has reinvigorated its player base with exciting DLC packages and beautifully gruesome graphics that has attracted a ton of new players on launch. 

As it has hit its two-year mark, it is time for *NetherRealm Studios* to take the successes of *Mortal Kombat 11*, and translate it to a newer installment. This means that DLC has been officially stopped, and we probably won't see any new balance patches coming through anytime soon, if at all. It is unfortunate that the news is so sudden since *MK11* has received only two balances patches in an entire year, and only one of those were major character balance changes.

Unfortunately some fans will never see their favorite characters shine in *MK11*, and it's time to look forward to the future. Although, Mortal Kombat 12 seems like the most simple transition for NetherRealm Studios to do, there have been some popular rumors floating around the past 24 hours since news broke out.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nether Realm took to twitter to announce it has started work on its next project, and there will be no more DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. Which game do you hope they work on next? <a href="https://t.co/S92GJd5xJn">https://t.co/S92GJd5xJn</a> <a href="https://t.co/ydi2CIlmUc">pic.twitter.com/ydi2CIlmUc</a></p>&mdash; IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1411112710444666886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Injustice 3 may be NRS's next big game.

The *Injustice* series has been a mixed bag of feelings when it comes to its fans. It was a fun way to introduce *DC*'s most popular storyline into mainstream media, and canonically duking it out between your favorite heroes is always a fun time. However, the gameplay generally suffered due to its clunky controls, combo structures, and interactions. Most notably, fans wanted something more intense from a darker *DC* storyline, and it didn't quite deliver what *Mortal Kombat* did. It seemed like a re-envisioned cosplay of *Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe*. However, *NRS* has bounced between the *Injustice* Series and the *Mortal Kombat* saga in recent history, so it is not out of the question that an Injustice 3 may be the next big thing.

## Marvel has just entered the conversation.

Fans are now speculating that *NetherRealm Studios* may be pivoting towards a *Marvel* game. Now, as it would be interesting to see a *Marvel* fighting game in *NRS*'s style. It is unfortunately all speculation, and the reality may be a lot further from the truth than we realize. *NetherRealm Studios* is not an independent studio and it is 100% owned by *Warner Brothers*. *Marvel* video games are classified under the *Marvel Entertainment* division that is owned by *Disney*, which was one of the biggest hurdles for *MVCI*. Hopefully, we are all up-to-date on that drama. It's going to be incredibly unlikely that *NRS* will be able to obtain the licensing rights to produce a *Marvel* game with *Disney* cosigning the deal. *Disney* is very strict on the artistic choices game developers have when using their property as *Disney*'s markets are generally aimed at a younger demographic (whatever sells the most toys).
